# Law-of-cooling-PINN
by implementing a PINN we can aproximate the curve and cooling rate of the cooling function for a specific case with as little as the shown 10 training points covering 1/3 of the functions domain. doing so allows us to train a solver for the ODE with extremely small amounts of data, that still manages to generalize over the domain of the function, and not overfit to the input data.

# Example (10 training points, 30000 epochs)
